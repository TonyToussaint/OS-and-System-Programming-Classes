1. Missing set and list built in functions.
 - has simple Unix commands 
 - has built-in commands
 - has error conditions
 - has pipe and redirection 
 
2. shell name is "techShell.c"
 - compile with -lreadline like so, "gcc techShell.c -lreadline"

3. Hope I do well. =D 

4. tested pipe using "ls -al | more" 

5. tested redirection using "cat some_file.txt > another_file.txt "
